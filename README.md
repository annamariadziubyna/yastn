Python library for differentiable linear algebra with block-sparse tensors, supporting abelian symmetries.
It supports a range of Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) and Matrix Product States (MPS) algorithms employing the core symmetric Tensor class.

##### YASTN tensors can be defined with both discrete and continuous abelian groups

- Z<sub>2</sub> for parity conservation
- U(1) for particle number conservation
- Direct product of abelian groups such as Z<sub>3</sub>xU(1) or U(1)xU(1)xZ<sub>2</sub> and so on

##### YASTN can run with different backends, including

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

It allows automatic differentiation (autograd) on backends which support it.

##### To see YASTN in action, see

- [Quickstarts](https://yastn.github.io/yastn/yastn.quickstart.html) for a few end-to-end examples of PEPS calculations.
- [Benchmarks](https://github.com/yastn/yastn_benchmarks), including basic DMRG example.
- [Full documentation](https://yastn.github.io/yastn/index.html) for multiple further examples.
- Two-dimensional tensor networks library [peps-torch](https://github.com/jurajHasik/peps-torch). It includes variational optimization of iPEPS with abelian symmetries for spin models powered by YASTN tensor.


### Install using

```
git clone https://github.com/yastn/yastn.git
cd yastn
pip install .
```
or just clone and add YASTN root to your Python import path to successfully ``import yastn``
(see `pyproject.toml` for dependencies).

### Run the tests

Tests, which are also a good source of usage examples, can be found in the folder `tests`.
To verify that everything works, get `pytest`. To test specific elements of the repository, run

```
pytest -v ./tests/tensor
pytest -v ./tests/operators
pytest -v ./tests/mps
pytest -v ./tests/peps
```

To test YASTN on PyTorch backend and integration of autograd features (assuming PyTorch is installed)
```
pytest -v --backend torch
```

To execute the tests on a GPU

```
pytest -v --backend torch --device cuda
```
