PEPS and its initialization
===========================

PEPS is an instance of :class:`yastn.tn.fpeps.Peps` which includes information about lattice geometry,
and each unique site is associated with a tensor.

Two auxlliary function to create a PEPS network are

.. autofunction:: yastn.tn.fpeps.product_peps

Examples are given in
:ref:`Purification<examples/fpeps/ntu:Thermal expectation value of spinful fermi sea>`,

.. autofunction:: yastn.tn.fpeps.load_from_dict
