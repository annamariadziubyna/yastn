Kibble-Zurek quench in 2D transverse-field Ising model
======================================================

This guide provides a quick overview of simulating the real time evolution of Kibble-Zurek quench in 2D Ising model using `yastn` tensor network library. We'll focus on
initializing the model, setting up the simulation, and calculating expectation values.
