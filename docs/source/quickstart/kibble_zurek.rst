Kibble Zurek Quench: Quickstart
===============================

This guide provides a quick overview of simulating the real time evolution of Kibble-Zurek quench in 2D Ising model using `yastn` tensor network library. We'll focus on
initializing the model, setting up the simulation, and calculating expectation values.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `yastn`
