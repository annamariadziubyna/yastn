Lattice geometry
================

The ``test_SquareLattice()`` function generates a few lattices and verifies the expected output of some functions. It checks the dimensions, sites, bonds, and nearest neighbor sites
of the lattice. The function is tested on both checkerboard and square lattices with infinite size and open boundary conditions.
